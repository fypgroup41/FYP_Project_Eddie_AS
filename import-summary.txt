ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Risky Project Location:
-----------------------
The tools *should* handle project locations in any directory. However,
due to bugs, placing projects in directories containing spaces in the
path, or characters like ", ' and &, have had issues. We're working to
eliminate these bugs, but to save yourself headaches you may want to
move your project to a location where this is not a problem.
C:\Users\test\Desktop\Android Debug2
                             -      

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* .gitignore
* ant.properties
* build.xml
* nbandroid\
* nbandroid\private.properties
* private\
* private\cache\
* private\cache\retriever\
* private\cache\retriever\catalog.xml
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* libs\commons-codec-1.9.jar => app\libs\commons-codec-1.9.jar
* libs\commons-logging-1.2.jar => app\libs\commons-logging-1.2.jar
* libs\fluent-hc-4.5.1.jar => app\libs\fluent-hc-4.5.1.jar
* libs\jna-4.1.0.jar => app\libs\jna-4.1.0.jar
* libs\jna-platform-4.1.0.jar => app\libs\jna-platform-4.1.0.jar
* res\ => app\src\main\res\
* src\ => app\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.
